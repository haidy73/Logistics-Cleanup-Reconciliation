# Delivery Orders Cleaner & Planner

This project processes messy delivery order data, normalizes it, assigns couriers under specific constraints, and reconciles actual deliveries against the planned schedule.  
It ensures **deterministic output** â€” the same inputs will always produce the same outputs â€” by applying consistent sorting, formatting, and mapping rules.
